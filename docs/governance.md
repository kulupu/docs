This page documents the current and future referendums of the Kulupu
network.

## Current referendum

Referendum No. 10 is to set the balance of treasury to _100000
KLP_. Note that technically, this can either mint to treasury or burn
from treasury, depending on how many coins treasury will have at the
activation block.

The voting begins on block 191520 (18 Sep, 2020) and ends on block
201600 (26 Sep, 2020).
